  <p>Hi, this is Abdullah and I'd like to welcome you to my blog ðŸ˜ƒ!</p>

  <p>
  <abbr title=" (2016) ">this year</abbr>, I graduated with a bachelor degree in Computer Science.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got into programming when I was 14, crafting little applications in VB6 and PHP ðŸ˜….
  </p>

  <p>
  During the study years, I worked and experimented with variety of languages such as C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby and JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
  What interests me most in technology is Web development, Data Science and Machine Learning. In the latter two, I did my graduation project about "offline handwriting recognition".
  </p>

  <p>
  Beside computer stuff, and when in boredom, I read. Philosophy and literature are my preferred areas in reading.
  </p>

  <p>
  I write here to share my thoughts, ideas, book reviews, and knowledge while learning. The learning journey never ends !
